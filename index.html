        <h2>The Model Y</h2>
        <p>The Model Y is Tesla's entry level SUV that comes with similar specifications as the Model 3. 
            This SUV doesn't come with all the bells and whistles that the Model X does, however, for the 
            price, performance, and features this car come loaded with, it is certainly a great contender.

    <h2>The Cyber Truck and Roadster</h2>

        <p>The Cyber Truck and Roadster are Tesla's newest addition to the family.
            While the Cyber Truck has yet to hit production, the over design and performance has buyers
            waiting paitently. The Design is something out of a futuristic movie and the price point is even
            more attractive.
            Similar to the Cyber Truck, the Roadster has turned heads being the quickest car in the world.
            Some might say it's even the fastest car in the world. With a ridiculously clean design, the Roadster
            accelerates to 60 miles-per-our in just shy of 1.6 seconds. These models are very steep in price,
            but for a valid reason.
